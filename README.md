- Truffle v5.0.0 or later
- Ganache CLI v6.0.0 or later
- Celo extension wallet
- A Celo Alfajores Testnet account with test CELO

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone your-repo-link`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd your-project-name`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start Ganache CLI with the following command: `ganache-cli --port 7545`
2. Compile the smart contracts: `truffle compile`
3. Deploy the smart contracts: `truffle migrate`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

The application should now be running on `localhost:3000`
